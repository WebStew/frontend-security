	<h1>Front-end Security Part 1 : Introduction</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p>Welcome to my first portal blog post. The plan for the first series of articles is to better equip us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development" target="_blank">front-end developers</a> on what types of application attacks we should be aware of and what techniques and resources are available, recommended and implemented by the community to combat against them. At the moment I am not sure how many parts this series will entail but I'll endeavour to keep it structured and point readers to helpful content around the internet relating to specific vulnerabilities. </p>

			<h3>So what is security?</h3>
			<p>Well Google describes
				<dl>
					<dt>security</dt> 
					<dd> as the state of being free from danger or threat</dd>
				</dl>
			</p>
			<p>This definition seems a very black and white description - can you ever be completely free from danger or threat? Perhaps a better definition is <em>actions taken to achieve a state which mitigates against threat or danger</em>?</p>

			<h3>So what are the threats?</h3>
			<p>Threats or system vulnerabilities within technology are generally referred to as attack vectors. An 
				<dl>
					<dt>attack vector </dt>
					<dd>is a path or means by which a hacker can gain access to a computer or network server in order to deliver a payload or malicious outcome. Attack vectors enable hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities, including the human element. </dd>
				</dl>
				There is an extensive <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Attack" target="_blank">list of these attack vectors within web applications</a> that we should be aware of as front-end developers. Knowing about these different attach vectors will be our best attribute enabling us to take the appropriate action for mitigating against them.</p>

			<h3>Resources</h3>
			<p>In my opinion some of the best resources available on the internet to help harden your application security is the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Open Web Application Security Project</a> ( <abbr title="Open Web Application Security Project">OWASP</abbr> ) and I will frequently refer readers to their content, suggested solutions and security hole pluggers within this series. There is a wealth of information gathered within this project which is useful to both <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project" target="_blank">back and front end developers</a>, <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project" target="_blank">software testers</a> and users of web applications.</p>
			<p>The OWASP core purpose being :</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP#Core_Purpose">Be the thriving global community that drives visibility and evolution in the safety and security of the world's software.</blockquote>
